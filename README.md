# elm-page-transition-example

example elm app with page transition animated in css. Three branches to checkout. There's no-navigation, (with elm navigation) and (with elm navigation and query parameters) Something about how each is a step up from the previous one.

### No Navigation

checkout the no-navigation branch for the example app. This version doesn't use elm-navigation. The upside is it's easy to use, and appropriate for transitioning between views, but if because there's no support for the browser back button, it's best not to use this approach if the user will be transitioning between what look to be pages.

### Up and running in dev mode

npm run dev
